Welcome to my new blog.

I'm Bruno, at the time that I'm writing this I'm 27, a husband, a dad of one boy and a software engineer.

Here I'll share my random thoughts.

This isn't a place just for tech-related content, but probably mostly focused on tech,

It's all experimental and I'm excited to see what ideas might pop here.

I hope it might be useful or at least funny for those who are reading.

Kindly,
Bruno.
